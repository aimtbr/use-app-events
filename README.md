# use-app-events

Global communication between components/hooks in React.

‚úâÔ∏è Send an event containing payload from one component/hook to another.
üì© Listen for events of a specific type to occur and process the sent payload.

### Install

**npm**

```
npm install use-app-events
```

**pnpm**

```
pnpm add use-app-events
```

<br/>

### TypeScript

- It is recommended to have a list of event types that can be used in your app, for example, enum called `EventType`, and pass it to `useAppEvents()` for type safety and misprint-proof:
  ![EventType passed to useAppEvents as a type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aimtbr/use-app-events/main/docs/image-1.png)
  <br/>
  <ins>This way you are protected from the unexpected event types...</ins>
  <br/>
  ![Unacceptable type passed as the event type to listenForEvents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aimtbr/use-app-events/main/docs/image-2.png)
  <br/>
  <ins>...and only allowed to use the expected ones.</ins>
  <br/>
  ![The expected allowed event type passed to listenForEvents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aimtbr/use-app-events/main/docs/image-3.png)
  ![The expected allowed event type passed to notifyEventListeners](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aimtbr/use-app-events/main/docs/image-4.png)
  <br/>
- However, if `EventType` is not provided, any `string` or `enum` can be used:
  ![Plain string passed as the event type to listenForEvents and notifyEventListeners](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aimtbr/use-app-events/main/docs/image-5.png)

<br/>

### Usage example

**Shared hook state**  
The example below represents a potential implementation of a simple `useVolume` hook, which allows managing a volume from any component of the app.

**[[See full source code]](https://github.com/aimtbr/use-app-events/blob/main/examples/shared-hook-state/SharedHookState.tsx)**

```tsx
const useVolume = () => {
  const [volume, setVolume] = useState<number>(100);

  const { notifyEventListeners, listenForEvents } = useAppEvents<EventType>();

  // 1. If any other instance of the useVolume hook has its volume state updated
  listenForEvents(EventType.VOLUME_CHANGE, (volumeNext: number) => {
    // 1.1. Synchronize the volume value of this instance, with a new one
    setVolume(volumeNext);
  });

  const updateVolume = (volumeNext: number) => {
    setVolume(volumeNext);

    // 2. Notify all other useVolume hook instances about the changed volume value
    notifyEventListeners(EventType.VOLUME_CHANGE, volumeNext);
  };

  return {
    volume,
    updateVolume,
  };
};
```

<br/>

### Motivation

Usually, it was recommended to use `React context` to manage the global state of the app without "prop drilling".

However, as the app grows, the number of `contexts` increases accordingly and partially ruins the readability and usability of your app.

<ins>So, the motivation</ins> to create `use-app-events` was to find a way to share and manage the state from any part of the app (globally) and allow all components to communicate with each other regardless of their position in the tree.
